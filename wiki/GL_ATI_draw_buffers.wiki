== Dependencies ==

The extension is written against the OpenGL 1.3 Specification.

OpenGL 1.3 is required.

[GL_ARB_fragment_program] affects the definition of this extension.



== Overview ==

This extension extends ARB_fragment_program to allow multiple output
colors, and provides a mechanism for directing those outputs to
multiple color buffers.



== New Procedures and Functions ==
{{{
void DrawBuffersATI(sizei n, const enum *bufs);
}}}


== New Tokens ==

Accepted by the <pname> parameters of GetIntegerv, GetFloatv,
and GetDoublev:

== Errors ==

The error INVALID_OPERATION is generated by DrawBuffersATI if a
color buffer not currently allocated to the GL context is specified.

The error INVALID_OPERATION is generated by DrawBuffersATI if <n>
is greater than the state MAX_DRAW_BUFFERS_ATI.

The error INVALID_OPERATION is generated by DrawBuffersATI if value in
<bufs> does not correspond to one of the allowed buffers.
