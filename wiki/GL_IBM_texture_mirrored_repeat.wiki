== Overview ==

IBM_texture_mirrored_repeat extends the set of texture wrap modes to
include a mode (GL_MIRRORED_REPEAT_IBM) that effectively uses a texture
map twice as large at the original image in which the additional half of
the new image is a mirror image of the original image.

This new mode relaxes the need to generate images whose opposite edges
match by using the original image to generate a matching "mirror image".


== New Procedures and Functions ==

None


== New Tokens ==

Accepted by the <param> parameter of !TexParameteri and !TexParameterf,
and by the <params> parameter of !TexParameteriv and !TexParameterfv, when
their <pname> parameter is TEXTURE_WRAP_S, TEXTURE_WRAP_T, or
TEXTURE_WRAP_R_EXT:

||GL_MIRRORED_REPEAT_IBM || 0x8370 ||


== Errors ==

None


== New State ==

Only the type information changes for these parameters:

|| *Get Value* || *Get Command* || *Type* || *Initial Value* ||
||TEXTURE_WRAP_S     || !GetTexParameteriv || n x Z5 || REPEAT ||
||TEXTURE_WRAP_T     || !GetTexParameteriv || n x Z5 || REPEAT||
||TEXTURE_WRAP_R_EXT || !GetTexParameteriv || n x Z5 || REPEAT||


== New Implementation Dependent State ==
