== Overview ==

Blending capability is extended by defining a constant color that can
be included in blending equations.  A typical usage is blending two
RGB images.  Without the constant blend factor, one image must have
an alpha channel with each pixel set to the desired blend factor.


== New Procedures and Functions ==
{{{
void BlendColorEXT(clampf red,
                   clampf green,
                   clampf blue,
                   clampf alpha);
}}}

== New Tokens ==

Accepted by the <sfactor> and <dfactor> parameters of !BlendFunc:

||CONSTANT_COLOR_EXT              || 0x8001||
||ONE_MINUS_CONSTANT_COLOR_EXT   ||  0x8002||
||CONSTANT_ALPHA_EXT              || 0x8003||
||ONE_MINUS_CONSTANT_ALPHA_EXT    || 0x8004||

Accepted by the <pname> parameter of !GetBooleanv, !GetIntegerv,
!GetFloatv, and !GetDoublev:

|| BLEND_COLOR_EXT || 0x8005||


== Errors ==

INVALID_OPERATION is generated if BlendColorEXT is called between
execution of Begin and the corresponding call to End.
