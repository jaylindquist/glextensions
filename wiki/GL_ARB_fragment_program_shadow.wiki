== Dependencies ==

The extension is written against the OpenGL 1.3 Specification.

[GL_ARB_fragment_program] is required.

[GL_ARB_shadow] is required.

[GL_EXT_texture_rectange] affects the definition of this extension.


== Overview ==

This extension extends [GL_ARB_fragment_program] to remove
the interaction with [GL_ARB_shadow].

This extension defines the program option
"ARB_fragment_program_shadow".

If a fragment program specifies the option "ARB_fragment_program_shadow"

SHADOW1D, SHADOW2D, SHADOWRECT

are added as texture targets.  When shadow map comparisons are
desired, specify the SHADOW1D, SHADOW2D, or SHADOWRECT texture
targets in texture instructions.

Programs must assure that the comparison mode for each depth
texture (TEXTURE_COMPARE_MODE) and/or the internal texture
format (DEPTH_COMPONENT) and the targets of the texture lookup
instructions match.  Otherwise, if the comparison mode
and/or the internal texture format are inconsistent with the
texture target, the results of the texture lookup are undefined.


== New Procedures and Functions ==

None
