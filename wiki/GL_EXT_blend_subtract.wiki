== Dependencies ==

[GL_EXT_blend_minmax] affects the definition of this extension


== Overview ==

Two additional blending equations are specified using the interface
defined by [GL_EXT_blend_minmax].  These equations are similar to the
default blending equation, but produce the difference of its left
and right hand sides, rather than the sum.  Image differences are
useful in many image processing applications.


== New Procedures and Functions ==

None


== New Tokens ==

Accepted by the <mode> parameter of BlendEquationEXT:

||FUNC_SUBTRACT_EXT          ||      0x800A||
||FUNC_REVERSE_SUBTRACT_EXT  ||      0x800B||


== Errors ==

INVALID_ENUM is generated by BlendEquationEXT if its single parameter
is not FUNC_ADD_EXT, MIN_EXT, MAX_EXT, FUNC_SUBTRACT_EXT, or
FUNC_REVERSE_SUBTRACT_EXT.

INVALID_OPERATION is generated if BlendEquationEXT is executed between
the execution of Begin and the corresponding execution to End.
