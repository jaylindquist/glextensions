== Dependencies ==

OpenGL 2.0 is required.

[GL_EXT_gpu_shader4] or [GL_NV_vertex_shader4] is required.


== Overview ==

This extension provides the means to render multiple instances of
an object with a single draw call, and an "instance ID" variable
which can be used by the vertex program to compute per-instance
values, typically an object's transform.


== New Tokens ==

None


== New Procedures and Functions ==
{{{
void DrawArraysInstancedEXT(enum mode, int first, sizei count,
                            sizei primcount);

void DrawElementsInstancedEXT(enum mode, sizei count, enum type,
                              const void *indices, sizei primcount);
}}}

== Errors ==

INVALID_ENUM is generated by DrawElementsInstancedEXT if <type> is
not one of UNSIGNED_BYTE, UNSIGNED_SHORT or UNSIGNED_INT.

INVALID_VALUE is generated by DrawArraysInstancedEXT if <first> is
less than zero.
