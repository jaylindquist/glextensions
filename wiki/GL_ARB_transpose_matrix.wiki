== Dependencies ==

This extensions is written against the OpenGL 1.2 Specification.
May be implemented in any version of OpenGL.


== Overview ==

New functions and tokens are added allowing application matrices
stored in row major order rather than column major order to be
transferred to the OpenGL implementation.  This allows an application
to use standard C-language 2-dimensional arrays (`m[row][col]`) and
have the array indices match the expected matrix row and column indexes.
These arrays are referred to as transpose matrices since they are
the transpose of the standard matrices passed to OpenGL.

This extension adds an interface for transfering data to and from the
OpenGL pipeline, it does not change any OpenGL processing or imply any
changes in state representation.


== New Procedures and Functions ==
{{{
void LoadTransposeMatrix{fd}ARB(T m[16]);
void MultTransposeMatrix{fd}ARB(T m[16]);
}}}

== New Tokens ==

Accepted by the <pname> parameter of GetBooleanv, GetIntegerv, GetFloatv,
and GetDoublev

||TRANSPOSE_MODELVIEW_MATRIX_ARB   || 0x84E3||
||TRANSPOSE_PROJECTION_MATRIX_ARB  || 0x84E4||
||TRANSPOSE_TEXTURE_MATRIX_ARB     || 0x84E5||
||TRANSPOSE_COLOR_MATRIX_ARB       || 0x84E6||



== Errors ==

No new errors, but error behavoir is inherited by the commands
that the transpose commands are implemented on top of
(LoadMatrix, MultMatrix, and Get`*`).


== New State ==

None

TRANSPOSE`_*_`MATRIX_ARB refer to the same state as their non-transposed
counterparts.


== New Implementation Dependent State ==

None
