== Overview ==

The base OpenGL provides clamping such that the texture coordinates are
limited to exactly the range [0,1].  When a texture coordinate is
clamped using this algorithm, the texture sampling filter straddles the
edge of the texture image, taking 1/2 its sample values from within the
texture image, and the other 1/2 from the texture border.  It is
sometimes desirable for a texture to be clamped to the border color,
rather than to an average of the border and edge colors.

This extension defines an additional texture clamping algorithm.
CLAMP_TO_BORDER_SGIS clamps texture coordinates at all mipmap levels
such that NEAREST and LINEAR filters return the color of the border
texels.  When used with FILTER4 filters, the filter operation of
CLAMP_TO_BORDER_SGIS is defined but doesn't result in a nice
clamp-to-border color.
