== Overview ==

The base OpenGL provides clamping such that the texture coordinates are
limited to exactly the range [0,1].  When a texture coordinate is
clamped using this algorithm, the texture sampling filter straddles the
edge of the texture image, taking 1/2 its sample values from within the
texture image, and the other 1/2 from the texture border.  It is
sometimes desirable to clamp a texture without requiring a border, and
without using the constant border color.

This extension defines a new texture clamping algorithm.
CLAMP_TO_EDGE_SGIS clamps texture coordinates at all mipmap levels such
that the texture filter never samples a border texel.  When used with a
NEAREST or a LINEAR filter, the color returned when clamping is derived
only from texels at the edge of the texture image.  When used with
FILTER4 filters, the filter operations of CLAMP_TO_EDGE_SGIS are defined
but don't result in a nice clamp-to-edge color.

CLAMP_TO_EDGE_SGIS is supported by 1, 2, and 3-dimensional textures
only.
