== Overview ==

When normal rescaling is enabled a new operation is added to the
transformation of the normal vector into eye coordinates.  The normal vector
is rescaled after it is multiplied by the inverse modelview matrix and
before it is normalized.

The rescale factor is chosen so that in many cases normal vectors with unit
length in object coordinates will not need to be normalized as they
are transformed into eye coordinates.
