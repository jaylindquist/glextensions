Written based on the wording of the OpenGL 1.2.1 specification.


== Overview ==

It is useful to be able to multiply a number by itself in the blending
stages -- for example, in certain types of specular lighting effects
where a result from a dot product needs to be taken to a high power.

This extension provides four additional blending factors to permit
this and other effects: SRC_COLOR and ONE_MINUS_SRC_COLOR for source
blending factors, and DST_COLOR and ONE_MINUS_DST_COLOR for destination
blending factors.

Direct3D provides capability bits for advertising these additional
blend modes.
